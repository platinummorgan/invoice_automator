        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: February 12, 2026</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Swift Invoice ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect information that you provide directly to us, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Account information (name, email address)</li>
            <li>Business information (business name, contact details)</li>
            <li>Customer information (names, email addresses)</li>
            <li>Invoice data (amounts, descriptions, dates)</li>
            <li>Payment method instructions</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide, maintain, and improve our services</li>
            <li>Create and manage your invoices</li>
            <li>Help you draft invoice and receipt emails</li>
            <li>Authenticate your account and ensure security</li>
            <li>Respond to your comments and questions</li>
            <li>Process subscription payments through Google Play Billing</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>
            Your data is stored securely using Supabase, a secure cloud database platform. We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We use the following third-party services:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Supabase:</strong> Cloud database and authentication service</li>
            <li><strong>Google Play Billing:</strong> Payment processing for Pro subscriptions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            When you choose to email an invoice or receipt, Swift Invoice opens your device's email application with a pre-filled draft. Emails are sent by your email provider from your device, not by Swift Invoice servers. Subscription payments are processed by Google Play Billing according to Google's privacy policy.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
            We retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. You may delete your data at any time by deleting your account or individual records within the app.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You have the right to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Access your personal data</li>
            <li>Correct inaccurate data</li>
            <li>Delete your data</li>
            <li>Export your data</li>
            <li>Withdraw consent at any time</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Subscription and Billing</h2>
        <p>
            If you purchase a Pro subscription ($3.99/month), your payment is processed by Google Play Billing. We store your subscription status and purchase token to verify your subscription. Google's privacy policy applies to payment information.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            Our service is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
        </p>

        <h2>10. International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>
            Your information may be transferred to and maintained on servers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where data protection laws may differ from those of your jurisdiction.
        </p>

        <h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy and, where appropriate, providing notice through the app.
